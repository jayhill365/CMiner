 This script will download the .NET Framework installer from the specified URL and start the installer with the "/quiet" and "/norestart" options, which will run the installer in quiet mode (without displaying any UI) and prevent the system from being rebooted afterwards.

To use this script, you'll need to replace the URL to match the version of the .NET Framework that you need. This script is built to download and install the runtime version 4.0.0 specifically. It is recommended to run this script on an endpoint that you have the permission to install software on, also note that if the endpoint already has the required version of the framework then running this script will not make any changes.

It's worth mentioning that you need to have the correct version of the .Net Framework that match the application's requirement.
